# summerProject

The purpose of this project is to showcase how I code in a project that is not a simple small project. The easiest way to showcase my coding ability was through creating
the framework for a story based video game. I would like to note that this game is not anywhere near done or balanced, it is simply for one to see some of my code
in which I solve various issues.

Many C++ (and programming) concepts are shown throughout this project, including:
-Vectors
-Arrays
-Pointers
-OOP Design
-Multi-file Programs (Header and .CPP Files)
-Arrays of Arrays
-Effective Documentation
-Inheritance (Inheritance Chains)

I would like to note that this project doesn't include all I know, and surely won't include what I learn in my Senior year of college.
Other topics will be showcased in either other projects or through assesments of some sort in the future.

As another note, I do understand that this project does include some issues, mainly that it only will work on windows given specific functions used.
I understand this is an issue, however these features are only used to make the game feel more 'game-like' and would never be included in
functional software in most cases.

Hopefully this program showcases some of my abilities at the current date. 

Thank you for reading.
