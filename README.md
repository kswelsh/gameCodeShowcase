## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills, at the time, in C++ and programming.
While I believe that I will learn more and become more expierenced at programming, this is a good
current showcase of what I have to offer. All files are my own creation.

## Note
Because of how I coded this program, it will only work on windows. I understand
this is not the best design, but to showcase what I have to offer it will do for now.
